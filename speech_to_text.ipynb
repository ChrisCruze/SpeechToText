      "Full text: If you look at an end user journey and i'll just give you an example cuz if we flushed it out with use that this many of our pigs at work. If you look at these are journey of deploying of visualizations into production that he's our journey is not started when i click the button to deploy. Production started when i say. My mind i've developed the dashboard. I want it in production. Now i know i need to go and you know that's technically when when the journey starts cuz i don't know what i'm doing i have to go search for the answer of how to find it we can't really control much about that but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not part of the journey i click on the button. Out of my house. And that is what i'm looking to have as a starting point for all. Journeys to get access to tools. Journey to share work clothes to put your clothes production to run work was eccentric point is when the user can no longer take the next step on their own. They require an automation something else somebody else to step in interview interfere so. Whitsett. I was tableau i want to be able to have a metric. Did i say it takes. Two days we got a tableau dashboard into its production. Analysts on the front end would look at them say that my experience it takes that's accurate. Well one at 1 and 1/2 of those days is actually waiting for your manager to approve it not on a saturday. That is the system say got the approval. Pushed it into production that's the message that we want to be able to deliver to the analysts and we're doing it on a weekly basis so. Looking at those metrics week-over-week i do a lot of them will change a lot. We just want to get that user experience. Triangle. Are we as a team will come up with or need to come up with certain journeys. Against the start clicking the stopwatch is the last step that they can do on their own before they have to make it somebody else's problem and then. And pointed whatever that intent was his result. Gotcha. That makes sense. That's really good contacts. You know this stuff here. They have to. Dad. Geneseo honor all that good stuff. And i think i seen that stopwatch makes sense that i think it starts here but i'll look more into it and then i'll. Provide that information as well. And there could be a back-and-forth again to someone grab td2 would be. Go for psych mpd2 it says envoy the click that so form out. Go. And then it could be a back-and-forth between. I have to do and things i have to do. I make sense. Yeah luckily there is as great onboarding. so i think it'll be a good. Starting point. And i should have you. What i told chris is that. We would start the stopwatch at the last step that a person. What i am. Recognizing that i don't capture when i do that is if the forms that the user has to fill out to click the button to sasa fit go and start stopwatch. Is egregious and horrible and paving. Slingo if you have a way with mpd2 to say no no we've got a very clear way the. The user starts on the floor man gauges with it and then they click this events you could start stopwatch earlier when they open the forum. Ideally would be able to track that at least without fixing the tableau you can't because they. Open it up. Goes off and do something else and then come back and it's not really something that you'd be able to easily track. What makes sense. And then only other. Question i think on that aspect is. Is there any might differ based on which route. The person might take. So. Especially this. Two different ways to connect to empty to and this is where i guess this would be after the onboarding process but you think this. Should be included within that journey or. Can you connect auntie to you know in these five different ways and it might vary depending. What is so i'm sorry what was the question i guess it's part of. The envoy would you consider this as part of on voiding. Like getting the shoes for getting the outfit stool. Getting all these tools. Would you think that that's okay. Would be what i would do is i would say. Yes we want these are the first start using it and let's see if the data bears out that the moment they get that email that says. Congratulation and whatever it is. If we could just measure that time and will determine whether to include it in your not. Take that time worker but that also looks of the time that they. Are able to do it to where they first executed. Cool that make sense. Yeah and luckily i'm meeting tomorrow with one of the tenants. So it'll be in a good i'm just trying to get to know the tenants that way i can like run it something by them it to see if it sounds right so after i get the numbers off. Justin running. Let's just make sure. Some other items here just so you know questionnaire. Everyday i'm during i'm part of the. Part of the stand up. But all three. And i wonder things are. You know it's korn band name. And wondering it like there's obviously a lot of ways to improve their processes specially. Navien a kanban team. I guess my question is. Should i should i should i should i help improve. The process of the camdenton cuz i know we don't have a scrum master that's more the scrum masters role. And i know leslie she was really just there listening and when they're fires relation. I guess i'm kind of answer my own question. Okay. I don't have an answer for you whatever you think it will take to do the job better if it's the answer is a that there should be a scrum master where you guys. Yeah. Anton 11 datapoint i was thinking to capture at least from from that whole year process is. You know that the tickets that come in or they could be deposit ready could be issues with the platform and maybe measuring. That overtime might be a good way to determine if the platforms getting better or more issues arising so maybe that's one. Interesting table fan. Used rav4. Yes please anything that we can do like i said i'm at a real struggle fighting. Experience. because they don't have them. Remember to send a team meeting for us next week if i'm not mistaken. Chrome this week. If i if i haven't said it yet. Electrical space. What people are doing our platforms. Fart. Robin are supposed to be this week. And that's kind of where i want to bring up like should we have a big tenant meeting i think there used to be one. So that sound works. Oh that would be great. You said wednesday. Do i look to schedule the meeting either thursday or friday and the takeaway or the prep. Speak about the pain points and the friction points of the stuff that people do with our platform stools. Yes absolutely. That makes sense. The other question i had you know just an idea for later on. But it'd be cool monthly email digest from tenants. You know the written used casing. Immediately having his example to byl yamo. File currently we have 320 phone boarded. And there might be other tenants that might be interested in it stuff like that like things at the times can do or are utilized. I think i want to see now. So. Corte de vela. In my previous limited something similar and i was able to actually customize every the email to every person because we had a. Datasource that was telling us. Which dashboard is using was looking at and which ones it wasn't. I'm thinking maybe we can do something similar for the tenants and. Customize a message them that can maybe be helpful in in. Tracking certain behaviors that we might want from the jail. Email channel is. People expect to get excited about it because that you know they said a rule for it otherwise it comes out from broadcast. If you ignore it when you personalize it included. Exactly exactly. What what we did just like top 10 users of this dashboard versus. Versus you know talk to him another one. Definitely. And another thing yeah just following up you know i know we talked about. Play van training. How are you wanted to work with me in python so. I just wanted to bring it up again happy more than happy to do it maybe we have a few. Use cases already has. What we can do pair programming or something i don't know. Yeah that's more about for fun thing on a. Robertson friday or something. No i'd love to let's get into it i'm trying to think of the best method to learn it as a teacher of python. What do you recommend. Yeah so in terms of the best method to learn it. I mostly having a project is definitely like the best best way to learn it. At least for me it is. + 9. You know having a common jupyter notebook i think would be good for us to work as a team. In-n-out in a list python tussaud. I'm i'm going to set up i've already started setting up bitbucket. I talked to don about the stupid essentially. It'd be good for us all. Be able to leverage bitbucket to share code amongst each other and. And review each other's code cuz i think that'll be a way. Wrestler from each other to for example. Madonna 9. We met on friday one of the ideas proposed as you know when i make a change to the site. It go to the bitbucket process into that bitbucket process there's an approval. Processing in matter floyd kind of start to see. How it's working and and make sure that you know we're all on the same page. What i should do. You know because we. Over the next few. We're going to have to work really closely the team to deliver on these metrics that i'm talking about. Pause really quick and explain what chris is looking to do with that. But the problem is is whenever we face an issue. Being our anecdotes for society's anecdote. Politics overcomes ethnicity. Physically gaining the data points will give us a better foundation and footing when we want to say to it. This is not meeting the service-level objectives that we your indicators are off and then. This is critically important because i t. Rear-ended in a rare exception right now if you're still in ccp. Is focus on engaging ccp teks through andy mcclure. And sag neur contractor. Go and. The subcontractors ny. Film. That scares me half to death because it's going to be direct to the source now you've got a middleman who's annie and he's very good.. But it will be all that much more important for us to come to the table to annie to give her the ammunition she needs to be able stay. Instead of what people have been saying ew is slow right. The same look. At 5 p.m. traffic is so bad everybody's getting sued and it's causing issues to deliver the business in this missing this query. That'll give her as a contractor the evidence she needs to go subcontractor grady. Thinking that what we do is we meet over the next few weeks and we have a set if you we can work this is a project do it in python. Yeah i got a lot of it building out tricks but if we started that. Ideate around customer journeys. Basics of python. Spider. How should i comment how should i use bitbucket all that kind of stuff. Is an operating model down and then start learning the fundamentals. Learn how to integrate. Yeah yeah. And unfair for those data-driven. In almost giving up. Annie's fabric. Maybe a source. For some of that i have to look i'm going to meet with someone from telemetry to make sure. I can do some of this no more stuff at aaron's. I doing i was being able to measure stop measuring performance resembles. Yeah i know that they're working with eric beck. Yeah. Somebody call the platform. Okay so the next slide on this here. So. Wanted to show you against two of the. Show my previous see my belt things for them. I things to two things in particular. One of the tableau extension. And maybe i can do this. Insite portal. And this is kind of what i was saying in the chat. 4. I'm already getting a few things from a few people for wondering. Should i ask am i going to continue supporting this. Any team. So my question is. Does this fit within scope of rok arse like a tableau extension. Like. I mean. Sheryl crow. I got you. So this component here. Navigation. Tableau extension. And you important like a plug-in. And what would allows you to do is essentially just navigating months a lot of dashboards. I want you have. A lot of dashboard. The folks of used it like it a lot better than. Then this type of navigation. Navigation here looks. Little cleaner looks better it's easier and more convenient. So a lot of variable at least a few area products or interested in using this extension. Iso. Celeste. That's pretty much. It is some wondering if it's within our scope. To support such a thing like this. That would be that would be. I am always in favor of anything we could do to remain on the cutting edge closer to the closing business what they need to see what they need to do i have. We no longer on the team have any role directly. Representing. We still have that remix. But i'm relying entirely on the technology team with john conlon that guys to warm their duties and follow up when there's ever any problems. If we were to expand your role to include the visualization piece i could see that maybe we'd have a niche. Frick you in something like this. My concern is what kind of support is going to come out what kind of advancements what kind of things are they going to want to do dishes that could eat eat up your time. Yeah. Yeah that makes sense like as long as it takes up in a small percentage of time you know. Continuously supporting but figure right especially the higher priorities are more of the data consumption. Pieces of things sound. What i would say is eustace is a is a test. How easy is this ticket because we're all about cell service and just because a business team relies on another business team. Doesn't mean that they're not. Not to be dependent on it. Easton. Viable for us to market is it go to go to market. Cuz if your naked self service then it's it's off living and breathing on its own and then they can. Continue.. Do you think they have that skill-set on their team we're thrilled that interest. So. So what i did so far as far as extension goes is i do treat documentation on how to maintain and create the extension. You know on their own self. I'm actually. One of the one of the people sometime in my calendar and i'm going to be able to. Ask them like. Snowbasin documentation on how you can do this yourself like what are. Like what issues are you having. You know one of the things i was working on and in like a later phase is actually more deeply integrating it. Into the inside portal. Such that it wasn't part of. Didn't miss the tableau dashboard was part of it inside portal. And then that would make it super self-service because. Literally you know that the drop-down options are there. It's just a matter of changing the ui a little bit so that it displays in this way. So. Going to ccp in the inside portal integration route. That would make it completely self service. So that's kind of where it where that was. How would that work is that just said what you have them ads that menu far to the. Did the portal. Breadcrumb. Exactly so there's two options for that so one is and actually i had a version uhd. Demonstrative. Yeah so there's there's one option of great just integrated into the portal. So that it's just like a part of the portal. And there was another solution. I was looking at an alternative i think this is. Correct one. But essentially all of the person who's interested in it would have to do is append. A url. To the portal. Within the manage content. Suction here for every dashboard. The person is afraid in the dark but has a lot of options for configuration. And through that little form they can configure it and add it that way. Winter slowly. What does that point to a webpage that contains your extension plus an iframe. Yeah that's exactly right yeah. Dallas run. The only place where that might cause problems is when people try to create slides ring. Through. That's a great point actually that the slide creation piece i think that's where i was starting to run into an issue. I didn't do i didn't get. Or is it. So this is the example so i can see it's a little bit bigger. That's because. Mystery. Because the way that you can configure it this extension here is not part of the tableau dashboard it's rather. Miss the extension is actually rendering the tableau dashboard. So is it backwards. Iframe within. The. Lanai extension. So the other options in go as you can see here. Like this url. You can put it up anywhere. Wine essentially. What was he doing. Well just say this isn't the url for the centrally what it what it was. Is. You do a forward slash and then the extension url. And then what will happen is extension url would load. Other than here. And then whatever came after this. Would a wood mode the dashboard underneath it. That's how this is happening. So that's another way to make it really self service and really easy for anyone to a disney. Simply have to. Give extension url followed by the url of their dashboard in this tuition. Okay. Yeah but would. With the side creation piece working-out work. More testing is needed obviously cuz i haven't. Nose running into official with it. I just made. It looks like it is working like that i guess the slide creation just looks at that url but let's take a look. Yeah i have two test one. I would be cautious just because i know sarah and i know how things could go. I'm on survivor weekend. Yeah that's 70 show. But if you could teach them to do it and it's a good. Yeah i can have them. Then by all means cuz i'm extension for something that i remember being at the tableau conference. Said it was like. Yeah. You know it was quite the process i'm getting that extension ladder. Send a lot of emails you want to follow up yeah that's. Self-service. If this is not if you don't want to investigate the extensions further. I'm going to training them up on how to build maintain create whatever. Knowledge transfer from you. The second option is. Casey long is the new product owner for the portal. If enough people want it i think i shut you down last time. Because. Because it was the functionality that only you guys were interested in nobody else. So maybe if you guys if you convince casey that it's super easy. We could definitely put on the backlog. Yeah. Yeah i mean it cuz at the end of the day like. This this extension you miss navigation. Literally. This was built using the same library. That the ccd inside portal is. So just them having the idea of just changing this layout or adding a different layout option. With one like this instead of. Instead of this up here i think would be ideal in a. And i think sarah actually i've heard that sarah said she really likes. Discipling out. And as well as other people so maybe that that would actually be ideal if casey just takes it in. Set the ad okay so instead. A breadcrumb identify where you are to be able to take yourself back through and it was a little bit odd because he had the dashboard link to other dashboards from within themselves that wouldn't. So. Are you saying. Replace that breaker bar actual context-specific drop-down that i set up. When the content administrator adds the content. Yep pretty much and if you look at the inside portal. There is. You know. Lately have all the data they would need to make it. As well like for example you know right now that it's cat the navigation is all these different type of chapters. And. You know. Let me have enough layers. I within their manage content section to be able to. Create the chapters so maybe this. Play marcel. So they would just be pulling the data and just right here in a little bit differently. Puzzle. This is going to be overly complicated when we originally sia rising to the layers. I could put the instead of having. What they have now which is what do they call it. Heather. What do they have a manager the first one is. Like a category year. Portal. Just wondering. When is kwanzaa. I just open one of those if they had originally come to me whenever. You can do. Put it as app so instead of subcategories and then i could type in. Ccp and i could use a character that would be the parsing so it could be a carrot it could be a dash it could be whatever some special character. Ccp pipe card pipe. Freedom. I freedom unlimited. Corner awards and instantly the parsing engine would go back through and it would create. Stop navigation in the hamburger menu in midland. And then. I meant a little while later they're like. What i'm suggesting when it comes to your extensions if we maybe improvement going back to that make it a pipe and then you can have a different. Determine how it would appear when there it would appear in standard. Or whether it could be a drop-down menu. Something like that. Importantly i know it's a better you i am. You have the day to do it like this would be the shopper the same category in the topic would be those drop-down minds. But what i mean chapters like this operation matches. Down. What if i weeded the pipe method you were talking about orofino that's the meds that they can do that would allow the drop-down you can configure in such a way we're like. No you have operational metrics and then you can. Open up a sub menu and anakin. I can't go for that way. Amazing isn't it certainly isn't reading. Different options of the portal is tricky only because the portal resources are really. Development. Casey would be able to determine the prioritization of. Yeah. The magnifying glass to you. Well that was a search. Future. I guess it's coming soon. Should i remove that. Otherside. Take you through the different. Yeah so if you have more than seven chapters i think it was you. Yeah seven chapters then you can use that carrot. Pekarna ardmore. Chapters. If not it just keeps cycling through. This was out when using more than 7 convenience. Online. Carousel. And then i just had a fleeting. What myers briggs have you ever taken one. 8/8 yeah when i was a kid teenager and now i took it after i haven't taken it since i was. 188. Yeah i might i might do it again just to see if i. I forgot what i was actually. Yeah. Circus now you're an enfp. I think i need to go take the test over again. You know each other and stuff like that. You know more about her team always now. Well. Yeah that's all the ids and i. All the questions i have. I am off on friday but maybe we can meet on thursday to catch you up. Miami. Or before tina based on. That'd be great so far. Yeah i'll set up the team meetings and then. If you could put together like a python curriculum. I love the idea of a project we could started as a project that we could work it together as a team. Nothing is for certain things like nose often bitbucket her how to do certain things may be making a video. Just like a short one minute video of like how i do something. Maybe that's more effective then and it's easier also just make a quick video on how to do something instead of. Writing it out. Maybe that's one way so it's also. Knowledge. \n"
